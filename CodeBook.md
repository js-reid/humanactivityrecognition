# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## Code Book:  Human Activity Recognition by John Reid

Beyond those created using the read.table command, which share names with their files of origin, the following variables are present in the run_analysis.R file:
+ train:  Intermediate data set containing a consolidated version of the "train" components as described above
+ test:  Intermediate data set containing a consolidated version of the "test" components as described above
+ fullset:  Intermediate data set comprised of the consolidated "train" and "test" tables
+ partialset:  This is "fullset", but subsetted to only capture columns containing a mean or standard deviation
+ HAR_means:  This is the final data set which is organized by subject and activity type.  Contains 40 distinct rows, each of which has 79 data entries averaged for the subject/activity.

HAR_means contains the following variables.  Variables 3 to 81 are a mean of the values over the activity type for the subject:
"1" "subject" - a number from 1 to 30 identifying the subject
"2" "activity_type" - identifies the type of activity logged
